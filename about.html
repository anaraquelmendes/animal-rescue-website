    <h2>ABOUT US</h2>
    <h3>Our History</h3>

    <p>Loyal Rescue is a non-profit organization born out of a dream – to take out as many animals off the streets as possible.
      We give our dogs proper treatment before integrating them into families that give them love, affection and a dignified life.
      We currently maintain more than 40 animals that are constantly treated by veterinarians. We provide them with good quality food, potable water, shelters specially built form them and most of all love and affection.</p>

      <h3>Reasons to Adopt from an Animal Shelter</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1.	By adopting, you help reduce the number of abandoned dogs.</li>
        <li>2.	By adopting, you help animals that have been through a lot of suffering</li>
        <li>3.	It will cost you less as the cost of vaccinations is included in the adoption price. Depending on the animal, you can also save on housebreaking and training expenses. </li>
      </ul>
